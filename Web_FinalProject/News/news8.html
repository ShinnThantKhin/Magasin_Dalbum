            In a sworn declaration filed on Monday, Taylor Swift defended herself as the sole writer of 
            her 2014 hit "Shake It Off" in response to a lawsuit claiming she plagiarized some of the 
            lyrics.
            
            Songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler filed the lawsuit in 2017, accusing Taylor of copying 
            lyrics from 3LW's 2000 hit "Playas Gon' Play," which they wrote.

            For those who don't know, 3LW is a former R&B group consisting of Adrienne Bailon (The Real), 
            Kiely Williams (The Cheetah Girls), and Naturi Naughton (Power).

            “The lyrics to 'Shake It Off' were written entirely by me,” Taylor stated on Monday, according to 
            the Guardian. “Until learning about Plaintiffs’ claim in 2017, I had never heard the song 
            'Playas Gon’ Play' and had never heard of that song or the group 3LW.”

            Sean and Nathan cited an extreme similarity between 3LW's lyric "playas they gon' play and haters 
            they gonna hate" and Taylor's lyric "playas gonna play, play, play, play, and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate."
            

            Later in her motion, Taylor said that her inspiration for writing "Shake It Off" came from 
            "unrelenting public scrutiny" of her personal life, "clickbait reporting, public manipulation," 
            and other negativity that forced her to ignore the criticism and focus on her music.
            Taylor reiterated that she'd never heard of 3LW by announcing she wasn't allowed to watch TRL until 
            she was 13. She also said she'd never heard "Playas Gon' Play" on the radio, TV, or in film. 
            According to Taylor, the first time she heard the song was after the plagiarism claim was made.

            For anyone unfamiliar with TRL or Total Request Live, it was a music countdown show on MTV that ran 
            from 1998–2008.
            Although the lawsuit was originally dismissed in 2018, it was later appealed in 2021, with a judge 
            deciding there was "enough objective similarities."
