            Ariana Grande posted an Instagram Reel early Wednesday morning to show off 
            one of the new additions to her makeup brand, R.E.M. Beauty.
            
            The newest products are part of the line’s upcoming fourth chapter.
            
            The pop star starts off the clip with a natural, makeup-free look (which is 
            still flawless) as she shows off a tiny jar containing her shade of the new 
            cream “sweetener” concealer, which will be available in 60 different natural 
            shades, plus two artistry shades of black and white.
            
            Grande then dabs the product onto her under eyes with a cotton ball. In a 
            voiceover, she shares that she’s been using the concealer in secret for a year
            now, and that it’s the first product to feature their “R.E.M. hydrasmooth essence,”
            which includes hyaluronic acid, raspberry leaf extract, ashwagandha, and vitamin E. 
            “I like knowing that it’s hydrating and nourishing my skin while I’m wearing it,” 
            she notes. “A little goes a long way—the coverage is really impressive.”
            
            
            By the time the video ends, Ari has completed a full-face look, possibly teasing 
            more of the collection.
            
            Meanwhile, the brand’s account has been teasing the concealer for a few days, and 
            fans are psyched about the expansive release.
            
            “Shades for days. Can’t wait,” wrote one.
            
            “It’s the 60 shades off the bat for me! Let’s go inclusion for all the different 
            skin tones >>>> !!!!!” said another.
            
            “These products are out of this world. Thank you so much for making them” 
            
            And the positive commentary goes on. In less than an hour, the video had racked up 
            almost 400 thousand likes. The “out of body” chapter, including the concealer from 
            the video, drops on rembeauty.com at 6 am PST Thursday, July 28th.
