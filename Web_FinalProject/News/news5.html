            itzy bebe rexha single remix

            Today (July 22), the singer took to Twitter to announce the long-awaited 
            release of a new remix of her 2021 single, set to feature K-pop girl group 
            ITZY, due out on July 29. The announcement also came with a presave link.

            Rexha’s announcement of the remix’s release date comes a little over a month 
            since she previewed the track on her Twitter page, where she previewed the 
            opening seconds of the remake.

            “Coming soon. #ItzyXBebe #BreakMyHeartMyself,” she tweeted at the tiime. Members 
            of ITZY, Yeji and Ryujin, can be heard in the new clip, though it is currently 
            unclear if the rest of the girl group will be participating in the remix.

            Bebe first began hinting at the collaboration last month, after ITZY’s Yeji and Ryujin 
            performed a dance duet to the track on Studio Choom’s MIX & MAX series on YouTube, 
            catching the singer-songwriter’s attention.

            “Let’s get @ITZYofficial on the remix of break my heart myself!!!!” she tweeted at the time.
            Fans of the group later spotted that Bebe’s producer, Jussifer, recently started following 
            ITZY on Instagram, and began speculating that a collaboration was indeed in the works.

            Last week, ITZY dropped their first domestic release of the year with their fifth mini-album 
            ‘Checkmate’, led by the title track ‘Sneakers’. In support of the mini-album, ITZY will embark 
            on their first-ever world tour, also titled ‘Checkmate’, later this year.

            The tour will kick off with a two-night residency in Seoul this August, after which the girl group 
            will head to North America in October and November.
