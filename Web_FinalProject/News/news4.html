            Starcourt, which brought terror and destruction to Hawkins. Struggling with the 
            aftermath, our group of friends are separated for the first time – and navigating 
            the complexities of high school hasn’t made things any easier.

            Show creators The Duffer Brothers confirmed that Stranger Things will end with 
            season five.
