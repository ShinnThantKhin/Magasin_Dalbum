            Blackpink Lisa has once again made history at the 2022’s MTV VMAs awards as the first ever k-pop soloist 
            to get nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards.

            The 25-year-old Thai rapper made her solo debut with the single album Lalisa on September 10, 2021. 
            Within the first 24 hours, her debut album title track became the most watched video by a soloist garnering 
            73.6 million views, breaking the previous record of Taylor Swift’s Me! which had got 65.2 million views in 
            the first 24 hours.

            Blackpink Lisa’s Billboard Hot 100 charter single Lalisa has now marked history as it got nominated in the 
            MTV VMAs Best k-pop category along with BTS’ Yet To Come, Seventeen’s Hot, Stray Kids‘ Maniac, 
            Twice’s The Feels, and ITZY’s Loco.

            Blackpink Lisa’s impact remains unmatched not just in k-pop but more so globally as the Money crooner continues 
            to establish new records right from her debut.

            Speaking of the singer’s global domination, a fan gushed, “For the first time in history, a Kpop soloist has 
            been nominated at the VMAs. LISA continues to make history.”

            A second fan manifested seeing Lisa’s another banger song on MTV VMAs live performance saying, “Imagine Lisa 
            performing a rock version of “MONEY” in this year’s VMAs.”

            “Lalisa getting nominated for a VMA is not surprising, an underrated bop and excellent video finally getting 
            the justice it deserves. I’m so proud,” another tweet read.

            Summarizing the fandom’s feelings, a user wrote, “#LISA’s impact is unmatched! Queen Lalisa is taking over 
            the world. Congratulations on VMAs nominations.”

            After two years of wait, Blackpink is releasing a new song Ready For Love right before releasing their new album. 
            The upcoming track of Blackpink will be dropping on July 29th at 1 PM KST/ 12 AM ET/ 9.30 AM IST/ 5 AM BST.
