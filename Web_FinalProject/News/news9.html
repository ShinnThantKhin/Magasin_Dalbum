            With 15 debuts, Beyoncé ups her career total to 81 solo Hot 100 entries, dating to her first, 
            her featured turn on Jay-Z’s “’03 Bonnie & Clyde,” which debuted on the Oct. 26, 2002-dated 
            list and reached No. 4 that December. She followed with her first charted hit as a lead, 
            “Crazy in Love” (featuring Jay-Z), which reigned for eight weeks beginning in July 2003.

            Beyoncé passes Aretha Franklin (73) and Ariana Grande (70) for the third-most Hot 100 entries 
            among solo women in the chart’s 64-year history, after Taylor Swift (168) and Nicki Minaj (123). 
            Drake leads all acts with 276. 
            (As a member of Destiny’s Child, she earned 14 entries from 1997 to 2005.)

            Additionally, Beyoncé has now earned 47 solo top 40 Hot 100 hits. That’s the fifth-most of among 
            solo women, after Taylor Swift (86), Nicki Minaj (64), Rihanna (51) and Madonna (49).

            With 16 entries on the Hot 100 in 2022 alone, Beyoncé claims the most this year among women. 
            Bad Bunny and Future are tied for the most among all acts, with 24 apiece.

            Meanwhile, thanks to her feature on “Move,” Grace Jones appears on the Hot 100 for the first time in 
            over 35 years, dating to “I’m Not Perfect (But I’m Perfect for You)” in 1987 (No. 69 peak). Before that, 
            the singer/model/actress sent two songs onto the chart in 1977: “Sorry”/”That’s the Trouble” (No. 71) and 
            “I Need a Man” (No. 83). “Move” is now her highest charting entry. On Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Jones has 
            notched two top 10s: “Pull Up to the Bumper” (No. 5, 1981) and “I’m Not Perfect” (No. 9, 1987). She was 
            also a staple on Billboard‘s dance charts from the late ’70s through the ’80s, with further appearances into 
            the 2000s.
